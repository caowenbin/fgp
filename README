Fine Grain Profiler
-------------------

A simplistic profiler which uses sys.settrace to collect time spent executing each line.

Project is at a very early stage and has many issues.

fpg is not thread safe.

example:

import fgp

def test():
    fgp.begin() # start profiling after this line
    [i for i in range(10000)]
    fgp.end() # end profiling

test()
fgp.print_stats()


Shoul print:
Time(ms)        Hits            Line
--------------- --------------- ----------------------------------------
      30.000000           10001 test.py:test@5>[i for i in range(10000)]
